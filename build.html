<h3 style="margin-top:0;">how it works</h3>

<p><strong>start with a 45-minute intro call.</strong> we'll talk through what you're building and i'll build something small with you live. no cost, no pitch — just signal on whether we're a fit.</p>

<p><strong>then book paid sessions.</strong> 4-hour blocks ($1,200) or 8-hour blocks ($2,000). 10% off your first booking.</p>

<p><strong>for ongoing work</strong>, i offer fractional arrangements — running systems, shipping features, advising on architecture.</p>
