<h2 id="how-it-works" style="margin-top:0;">how it works</h2>

<p><strong>start with a 45-minute intro call.</strong> we'll talk through what you're building and i'll build something small with you live. no cost, no pitch — just signal on whether we're a fit.</p>

<p><strong>paid sessions</strong> are booked in focused blocks: 4 hours ($1,200) or 8 hours ($2,000). first session is 10% off.</p>

<p><strong>for ongoing work</strong>, i offer fractional arrangements — ai strategy, building an ai platform, advising on architecture, shipping ai products and features.</p>

<h2 id="fixed-price-packages">fixed-price packages</h2>

<p>for defined-scope work, i also offer fixed-price packages — architecture audits, build sprints, strategy engagements. <a href="/#fixed-price-packages">see all packages →</a></p>

<h3>the intro call</h3>

<p><strong>what do i need to prepare?</strong><br>
just be ready to talk about what you're trying to build and where you're at. screen share is helpful but not required. if you have a repo, figma, or doc you want to walk through, have it open.</p>

<p><strong>what happens on the call?</strong><br>
first 15 minutes: you tell me what you're building and what's blocking you.  

next 25 minutes: i build something small with you live — could be a prototype, architecture sketch, or working code.  

last 5 minutes: we'll decide together if there's a fit. if not, no hard feelings — i'll point you in the right direction if i can.</p>

<p><strong>what we might build live</strong></p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
  <li>a working MCP tool call</li>
  <li>a minimal chat app wired to OpenAI/Anthropic</li>
  <li>an auth + rate-limit gateway sketch</li>
  <li>a real repo refactor</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>do you do a sales pitch?</strong><br>
no. the call is about signal, not selling. at the end of the call we can mutually decide if there's a fit.

if so, you book more time. if not, i'll try to point you in the right direction.</p>

<h3>the work</h3>

<p><strong>who is this for?</strong><br>
this works best for founders or small teams who want to think while building — and leave the session with real artifacts, not slides.</p>

<p><strong>what types of things do you build?</strong><br>
AI apps (chatgpt plugins, claude apps, standalone products), agentic systems (multi-step workflows, tool-calling agents), model gateways (identity, rate limiting, audit trails), and internal copilots.

i work across the stack — frontend, backend, infrastructure.</p>

<p><strong>what tools/stack do you use?</strong><br>
next.js, typescript, firebase, openai, anthropic, mcp servers, the openai apps sdk. i adapt to your stack when it makes sense.</p>

<p><strong>how do i schedule after the intro call?</strong><br>
if we decide to move forward, i'll send a link to book and pay by credit card. you choose 4-hour to 8-hour timeslots. sessions are usually within 1-2 weeks of booking.</p>

<p><strong>can you work async or do you only do live sessions?</strong><br>
i start with live sessions because we move faster and you see exactly how i work. i do async work for ongoing fractional arrangements where we've already built trust.</p>

<p><strong>can you help me or my team work this way?</strong><br>
yes. if you're curious about AI-assisted development but don't know where to start, i can get you set up — claude code, a cloud backend, workflows that actually stick. it's not a course — it's a working session where you leave ready to go. most people see serious productivity gains within the first few sessions.</p>

<h3>how sessions work</h3>

<p><strong>what does a session look like?</strong><br>
we meet on google meet. i'm at the controls, but we build together — you're directing, asking questions, and shaping decisions in real time. it's collaborative, not a spectator sport. i don't record by default, but i can if you want a copy.</p>

<p><strong>what do i get after a session?</strong><br>
you get everything we build — code, configs, docs, whatever we produced. i'll push to your repo or send a zip, your call. no hostage-taking.</p>

<p><strong>can i reschedule a session?</strong><br>
yes, with at least 48 hours notice. less than that and the session is forfeit — i've already blocked the time. life happens, just let me know as early as you can.</p>

<h3>fractional arrangements</h3>

<p><strong>how does fractional work?</strong><br>
fractional is for teams who need more than execution — ongoing AI strategy, architecture, and shipping. typically 8-20 hours per week on a monthly retainer. i show up like part of your team: advising on what to build, how to prioritize, and where AI actually moves the needle. we agree on a weekly rhythm and go from there. if you're not sure, start with a few sessions and we can talk fractional once we've built trust.</p>

<h3>trust & security</h3>

<p><strong>will my data be safe?</strong><br>
i take security and trust seriously, especially when working on early or sensitive systems. i work with your data in an isolated environment, separate from all my other projects. i will not use your data for any purpose other than our consulting engagement, and i delete it within one year of our last session — or immediately upon request.</p>

<p><strong>do you sign NDAs or vendor agreements?</strong><br>
i generally avoid ndas and heavy procurement processes so we can move fast. as an on-demand dev, signing individual legal agreements with each client isn't practical for how i work. my data commitment above is what i offer — in writing, on this page. if your company requires formal paperwork, i'm probably not the right fit, and that's okay.</p>

<p><strong>will you share what we're working on?</strong><br>
never without permission. if i want to reference your project (even anonymously) in a build log or case study, i'll ask first.</p>

<h3>logistics</h3>

<p><strong>what's your timezone and availability?</strong><br>
i'm in us pacific. typically 10am–6pm or 7am–3pm depending on the day.</p>

<p><strong>what's your refund policy?</strong><br>
when you book a slot, you're reserving my time — so no refunds if plans change. but commitment is low: sessions start at just 4 hours, and you're never locked into more. if a session doesn't meet your expectations, you're always free to not book another.</p>

<p><strong>who is this NOT for?</strong><br>
teams who want someone to "just execute specs" without input. vague projects with no clear goal. companies that require NDAs, vendor agreements, or formal procurement.</p>

<hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid rgba(35,30,92,0.15); margin: 3rem 0 2rem;">

<h2 id="referrals">referrals</h2>

<p>know someone who should be building with AI? introduce us. if they become a paying client, you get a complimentary 4-hour build session — we'll ship something real together.</p>
