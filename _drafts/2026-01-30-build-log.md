### what i shipped today
the loop, hunch, and fork apps are live on the inner mcp server—that's my decision intelligence suite. i also spent a chunk of time wrestling with claude integration, specifically some oauth oddities. plus, i started planning a new app for personalized activity recommendations.

### claude's oauth demands client_id in metadata
integrating with claude wasn't as smooth as i'd hoped. i kept hitting authentication walls. turns out, claude needs the client id exposed in the oauth metadata. who knew? i had to expose it to get it working.

it's a reminder that even standard protocols like oauth can have quirks depending on the implementation.

### shipping the decision intelligence suite
loop, hunch, and fork are live. that meant creating new handlers, tweaking existing files, and setting up per-app tool filtering. i chose path-based routing over separate functions for each app—simpler deployment and management.

security was top of mind. i added rate limiting to the mcp handler to prevent abuse, and addressed wildcard cors and query length validation. i also wrote a comprehensive test suite—111 tests covering unit, handler, and integration aspects.

### new app: personalized activity recommendations
i'm sketching out a new app that recommends real-life activities. think personalized suggestions for things to do in your local area. i'm starting with content-based filtering for v1, then moving to collaborative filtering in v2.

the challenge is the cold start problem—how do you provide recommendations when you know nothing about the user? and how do you differentiate in the crowded location-based recommendation market?
