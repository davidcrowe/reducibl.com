### what i built today

i'm adding apprentice learning features to the app — auto-onboarding, completion reflections, structured study guides, and user artwork uploads. today i focused on phase 1 (auto-onboarding and completion reflection) and started laying the groundwork for phase 2. lots of schema updates and description tweaks to existing tools…

### updating tool descriptions

i started by updating the `tool_descriptions` in `handlers/innerTools.ts` to guide users through onboarding if their profile is missing.

```typescript
  getProfile: "When you need to understand the user's art background and preferences, retrieve their apprentice profile. If the profile is null, guide the user through onboarding: ask their skill level, preferred mediums, interests, and goals, then call saveProfile.",
  generateLearningList: "When the user wants a curated list of artworks to study based on a goal, auto-generate a learning list from the catalog that matches their profile and builds progressively in difficulty. Call getProfile first if you haven't in this conversation.",
```

the goal is to make the app more intuitive for new users… no more blank screens.

i also added a `reflection` field to the `completeQueueItem` schema and description:

```typescript
  completeQueueItem: {
    type: "object",
    required: ["listId", "itemId"],
    properties: {
      listId: { type: "string", description: "The learning list ID" },
      itemId: { type: "string", description: "The queue item ID to mark as completed" },
      reflection: { type: "string", description: "Optional reflection on what the user learned or found challenging while studying this artwork" },
    },
  },
```

this will let users record their thoughts after completing an artwork, making the learning process more active.

### registering new tools

i'm also prepping to add three new tools: `getSuggestions`, `submitAttempt`, and `listSubmissions`. that means updating `tool_scopes`, `tool_schemas`, `tool_descriptions`, and `tool_titles` in `handlers/innerTools.ts`.

i'll tackle the actual implementation of these tools tomorrow… for now, it's all about setting up the plumbing.

### next steps

tomorrow i'll finish implementing the new apprentice tools and start working on the artwork schema extensions for phase 2. it's a lot of work, but i'm excited to see these features come to life…
