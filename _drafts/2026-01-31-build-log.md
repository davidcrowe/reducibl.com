### what i shipped today
today was all about phase two of the apprentice app. user profiles, named learning lists, and a tool to auto-curate those lists. feels like it's finally becoming more than just a reference tool. plus, i finally squashed a gnarly auth0 bug that was blocking everything.

### auth0 scope hell
spent way too long wrestling with auth0. the scopes weren't being granted to the chatgpt client properly. i could've hacked around it, but i decided to fix the root cause. it's always tempting to take shortcuts, but in the long run, fixing the underlying issue is worth it.

### datasets vs. llms
building out the learning list curation, i realized i didn't need to call the llm every time. instead, i built a firestore-driven system. it's faster, cheaper, and more reliable. sometimes the best solution isn't the flashiest one.

### the distribution risk
started thinking hard about distribution. the risk isn't the idea, it's distribution. i'm planning a landing page with legal pages next. no need for a full saas version yet.
