### what i shipped today
launched a basic website for "apprentice" to show off ai-guided art study, and iterated hard on the "inner" website to nail the dark, introspective vibe. also built a reusable conversational intake chatbot. getting closer to launching something meaningful.

### data enrichment as the new moat
i'm increasingly convinced that the real value isn't just in the ai models themselves, but in the data you feed them. for "apprentice", i'm using ai to enrich the metadata of public domain artworks. it's slow going, but the quality is high enough for an mvp. so basically this is interesting execution but probably not many people will actually use it. i probably wont be monetizing this one. but interesting to show off capabilities.

### automated gtm digest agent
i'm tired of manually tracking metrics and brainstorming content ideas. so, i'm building a daily gtm digest agent. the plan is to have it pull data from various sources and summarize the key takeaways. the AI synthesis is the key part — raw signals are noise. the Gemini pass turns 50 links into 'here are the 3 things that matter today and here's what to post about them.' it will be a config-driven system, so i can easily add or remove data sources.

### all lowercase branding
for "inner," i'm going with an all-lowercase brand voice. it just feels right for the product. it's a subtle detail, but it contributes to the overall aesthetic. the website went through several iterations to get the look and feel i wanted. this is much better than where we started.
