### what i shipped today

i built websites for both apprentice and inner. the inner one is looking really good now.

i also designed the architecture for a daily gtm digest agent. it'll pull data from plausible, firestore, reddit, and hn, summarize it with ai, and email me a daily report.

### inner website polish

the inner website went through a ton of iterations today. it's all dark purple now, with a light blue memory board section that matches the chatgpt widget.

i also made everything lowercase — headings, buttons, even proper nouns like google cloud. it's a weird vibe, but i'm rolling with it for now.

### gtm digest agent

i'm building a daily gtm digest agent. it's a scheduled cloud function that pulls data from different sources.

the plan is to use gemini to synthesize everything into actionable insights. then email the digest via resend.

new rule… never rely on local .env files for secret management. always manage secrets in a dedicated secret manager at the org level
