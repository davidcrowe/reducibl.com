### what i shipped today
today i launched basic websites for both inner and apprentice. i also designed an automated "daily digest" agent to give me gtm insights. plus, i grabbed the `learnart.app` domain for apprentice.

### platform thinking: websites as templates
i launched a basic website for the apprentice app. landing page, gallery, privacy policy, terms of use — the works. i'm treating it as a template. the key decision: the website code lives in a separate repo. this reflects a platform-centric approach.

### inner's dark side (and the chatgpt widget)
the inner website is live too. it showcases the chatgpt experience, with dummy data. the design is dark and introspective, matching the app's emotional theme. but i had to iterate a lot. the chatgpt widget has constraints — system colors only. this meant significant adjustments to align with the app's brand.

### automating gtm insights with a daily digest
i'm building an automated "daily digest" agent. it'll give me a summary of key metrics, content ideas, and alerts. the goal is to automate gtm insights. no more manually checking dashboards. it's config-driven, so i can easily add/remove data sources. the apps are the flywheel, the data is the asset.
