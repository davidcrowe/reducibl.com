### what i shipped today
i made big progress on automating my daily build logs. it's a system that pulls images from claude code transcripts, uses gemini to pick the best ones, and writes a draft post. i also shipped a bunch of features to the apprentice web app, including collections and learning series.

### automating build logs: from zero to (almost) hero
i'm trying to solve a problem: i need to create more content to show people what i'm capable of. i used claude code to build a production chatgpt app. and in the back of my head I couldn't help but ask… is it secure? right now it feels more like 'this is what i did' and not so much 'this is why i did it or why its interesting or what i learned'.

the first version was… not great. the quality wasn't there. so, i'm trying a two-pass synthesis with gemini to avoid just regurgitating the transcript. i'm also pulling base64 images directly from the transcripts and desktop screenshots. who knew claude embeds images that way?

### apprentice web app: getting closer to launch
i added a collections page with infinite scroll and filters. think style, genre, difficulty… all pulling data directly from firestore. i skipped client-side search for now because the artwork catalog is getting pretty big. ![screenshot of the landing page with the "How it works" section](/assets/screenshots/2026-02-02/screenshot-6.png)

also built out learning series pages with artwork details and study guides. next.js 15 requires `params` to be a `Promise`... who knew? ![screenshot of study instructions on a series detail page](/assets/screenshots/2026-02-02/screenshot-4.png) there were some spacing issues. ![screenshot of the artwork detail modal with spacing issues](/assets/screenshots/2026-02-02/screenshot-5.png)

### infrastructure: firebase hosting and cloudflare dns
i'm setting up firebase hosting for the apprentice web app. went with firebase over cloudflare pages because i want to use firebase auth later. had to add a firestore rule for public reads on the `apprentice_artworks` collection, which was a good reminder to think about security.
