### what i shipped today
i automated the daily build log process, including drafting the blog post from claude code transcripts. i also shipped a new apprentice web app showcasing ai-guided art study. and, i had a security scare that highlighted the importance of careful secret management.

### automated build logs mean less work
the biggest win today was automating these build logs. it's a system that grabs claude code transcripts, synthesizes them into a draft blog post with gemini, commits it to a jekyll repo, and emails me an approval link. it's built with cron jobs syncing transcripts to gcs, a cloud function using gemini for synthesis, and an approval function that moves the draft to the published posts folder. the goal is a portfolio of shipped projects, driving awareness for jobs, consulting, and app users.

i chose gcs over firestore for storing transcripts because of size limitations. i also found that a two-pass gemini synthesis improved content quality. the first pass identifies the key points, and the second pass fleshes them out. this prevents gemini from just regurgitating the transcript.

### apprentice web app makes art more accessible
i launched a new apprentice web app. it has a collections page with infinite scroll and filters, learning series pages with artwork details and study guides, and a series preview on the landing page. it's all about showcasing ai-guided art study and providing a platform for users to explore and learn.

i opted for firebase hosting over cloudflare pages for better integration with firebase auth. client-side search was skipped due to the large artwork catalog. i did learn that next.js 15 requires `params` to be a `promise`.

### security first, always
i implemented some security measures to protect against prompt injection and secret leakage. i used a combination of .claudeignore, careful diff reviews, and secret management to mitigate risks. the big takeaway? people are the weak link in the security chain. you can have all the fancy tools in the world, but if someone isn't paying attention, it all falls apart.
