### what i shipped today
i got a system in place to automatically generate daily build logs, complete with screenshots, and commit them as drafts to my jekyll blog. it's not fully automated yet, but the quality of the generated logs is significantly better thanks to a two-pass synthesis process. plus, i accidentally exposed some auth0 client ids and had to clean that up, so there's that.

### two-pass synthesis for better build logs
i'm using claude code to build a production chatgpt app. and in the back of my head i couldn't help but ask… is it secure? claude code is great, but it can sometimes copy content verbatim from the transcript. that's not ideal for a build log, and it could potentially expose sensitive information.

so, i implemented a two-pass synthesis process. the first pass extracts the key information from the transcript. the second pass synthesizes that information into a more coherent and engaging build log. this helps to prevent verbatim copying and improves the overall quality of the content.

### accidentally committed auth0 secrets
the dangerous part: you might not notice. the output looks like normal code. the commit looks routine. but the secret is now in your git history or sent to an external server.

i accidentally exposed some auth0 client ids in screenshots and committed them to the public repo. i've removed them now, but it was a good reminder of how easy it is to make mistakes. new rule… never rely on local .env files for secret management.

### firebase hosting over cloudflare pages
i decided to use firebase hosting for the apprentice web app. cloudflare pages is great, but firebase hosting offers some features that are more convenient for this project. specifically, it integrates well with other firebase services, like firestore.
