# reducibl

applied AI studio — systems, apps, and infrastructure

**complexity is reducibl**

technical, architectural, organizational, strategic  
even the most complex applied AI systems can be reduced to core components that are simpler to build and faster to value.

i design and build AI products, agentic systems, and trust layers like gatewaystack.

## ai consulting

previously at aws and dell; educated at harvard and uchicago.  
now i help teams ship real AI systems fast using the openai apps sdk, mcp servers, and modern cloud infrastructure.

- ship AI apps inside chatgpt  
- build model gateways for user-scoped, auditable access  
- launch production AI systems and internal copilots  
- accelerate teams from prototype to production

## ai infrastructure

i built **gatewaystack**, secure user-scoped authentication for llm apps using the apps sdk and the model context protocol (mcp).

the gatewaystack modules form a composable architecture for user-scoped AI systems. each layer solves a foundational requirement of modern agentic applications:

- [`identifiabl`](https://identifiabl.com) — bind every request to a real user and context  
- [`transformabl`](https://transformabl.com) — safety, normalization, classification, and preprocessing  
- [`validatabl`](https://validatabl.com) — permissions, policies, roles, and organizational rules  
- [`limitabl`](https://limitabl.com) — rate limits, quotas, budgets, spend controls  
- proxyabl — identity-aware routing across models and providers  
- [`explicabl`](https://explicabl.com) — full audit trail, traces, and observability

individually useful but designed to interlock, gatewaystack defines the emerging trust and governance layer of the AI stack — the primitives every agent ecosystem will eventually rely on.

## ai apps

i also created [**inner**](https://innerdreamapp.com), a jungian dream-analysis app that helps people understand the symbols, inner associations, and dynamics of their dreams — and how these patterns reveal unconscious processes shaping daily life.

inner helps users collect dreams and memories, map emotions over time, and explore personal meaning through an agentic LLM interface.  

it’s available in the ios app store and inside chatgpt as an emotional and personal memory context layer for llms.
