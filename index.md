**applied AI studio** — i help teams ship AI systems fast

## work with me

i build AI products with founders and teams — live, on-camera, in focused sessions. chatgpt apps, mcp servers, model gateways, internal copilots.

prototype to production in weeks, not months.

[book an intro call](/build) — 45 minutes, no cost, we'll build a working prototype — live

### what i've shipped

[**inner**](https://innerdreamapp.com) — emotional memory for LLMs, available as a chatgpt app and on iOS

[**apprentice**](https://learnart.app) — AI-powered art study across 37,000+ masterworks

both run on [gatewaystack](https://gatewaystack.com), the trust and governance layer i built for user-scoped AI access.
