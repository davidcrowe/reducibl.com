# reducibl

reducibl is my applied AI studio — a place for the systems, apps, and infrastructure that i build.

complexity is reducible. even complex applied ai systems can be broken down into core components that are simpler, easier to build, and faster to value.

i design and build AI products, agentic systems, and trust layers like gatewaystack. previously at aws and dell; educated at harvard and uchicago; now helping teams ship real AI systems fast using tools like the openai apps sdk, mcp servers, and modern cloud infrastructure.

- built AI apps that run inside chatgpt via the apps sdk  
- designed model gateways for user-scoped, auditable model access  
- shipped multiple production AI apps and internal copilots  
- helped teams move from no-code mvps to real AI backends
