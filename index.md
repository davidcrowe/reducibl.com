## work with me

i build AI products with founders and teams — live, on-camera, collaboratively, in focused sessions. 

from zero to working production system in *weeks*, not months.

you walk away with a real system your team can use immediately. not a prototype, not slides. ready to deploy or iterate on.

best fit for founders or small operating teams -- including those in enterprise and pe-backed environments -- serious about shipping ai. 

i work equally well with technical and non-technical clients. 

[**book an intro call**](/build) — 45 minutes, no cost, we'll build together — live

### what i've shipped

[inner](https://innerdreamapp.com) — emotional memory for LLMs, available as a chatgpt app and on iOS

[apprentice](https://learnart.app) — AI-powered art study across 37,000+ masterworks

both run on [gatewaystack](https://gatewaystack.com), the trust and governance layer i built for user-scoped AI access. it handles identity, permissions, and auditability.
