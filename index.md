# reducibl

**a product team of one.** live, on demand applied ai strategy and engineering

*from idea to production in weeks*

most AI projects don't fail because of the models. they fail because nobody owns identity, permissions, or the path to production.

## recent builds

- deployed a saas product as chatgpt app in 7 days
- implemented mcp auth live in a single session — with role level scopes
- integrated internal database with chatgpt enterprise in hours — with auditability for each call

## ai sprint sessions {#sprint-sessions}

i build AI products with founders and teams — live, on-camera, collaboratively, in focused sessions.

from zero to working production system in *weeks*, not months.

you walk away with a real system your team can use immediately. not a prototype, not slides. ready to deploy or iterate on.

best fit for founders or small operating teams -- including those in enterprise and pe-backed environments -- serious about shipping ai.

i work equally well with technical and non-technical clients.

[**book an intro call**](/build){: data-track="Homepage: Book Intro Call"} — 45 minutes, no cost, we'll build together — live

## fixed-price packages {#fixed-price-packages}

i also offer fixed-price packages for scoped deliverables starting at $10k

**assess → build → harden**

**assess**

[***genai initiative prioritization***](/offers/genai-prioritization-workshop){: data-track="Offer: GenAI Prioritization"}

a focused review of your AI stack with a prioritized action plan

[***build vs buy analysis***](/offers/build-vs-buy-analysis){: data-track="Offer: Build vs Buy"}  
a structured analysis of whether to build or buy AI capabilities — with cost models and a clear recommendation

**build**

[***idea-to-pilot sprint***](/offers/idea-to-pilot-sprint){: data-track="Offer: Idea to Pilot"}  
one week to turn your AI idea into a working pilot — validated, functional, ready to demo  
[*see how this worked for apprentice →*](/case-studies/apprentice-pilot)

[***mcp server build sprint***](/offers/mcp-server-sprint){: data-track="Offer: MCP Sprint"}

<summary><strong><em>not ready for a package?</em></strong></summary>
<p>start with a single sprint session. we'll pick one problem, build live, and you'll see how i work — no commitment beyond the session. if it leads somewhere, great. if not, you walk away with working code.

## what i've shipped

[inner](https://innerdreamapp.com) — emotional memory for LLMs, available as a chatgpt app and on iOS

[apprentice](https://learnart.app) — AI-powered art study across 37,000+ masterworks

[agentic control plane](https://agenticcontrolplane.com) — own your AI governance layer

all three run on [gatewaystack](https://github.com/davidcrowe/GatewayStack), the trust and governance layer i built for user-scoped AI access. it handles identity, permissions, and auditability.
