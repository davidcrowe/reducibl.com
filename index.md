# reducibl

**a product team of one.** live, on demand applied ai strategy and engineering

*from idea to production in weeks*

most AI projects don't fail because models are bad. they fail because nobody owns identity, permissions, or the path to production.

## recent builds

- deployed a saas product as chatgpt app in 7 days
- implemented mcp auth live in a single session — with role level scopes
- integrated internal database with chatgpt enterprise in hours — with auditability for each call

## ai sprint sessions {#sprint-sessions}

i build AI products with founders and teams — live, on-camera, collaboratively, in focused sessions.

from zero to working production system in *weeks*, not months.

you walk away with a real system your team can use immediately. not a prototype, not slides. ready to deploy or iterate on.

best fit for founders or small operating teams -- including those in enterprise and pe-backed environments -- serious about shipping ai.

i work equally well with technical and non-technical clients.

[**book an intro call**](/build) — 45 minutes, no cost, we'll build together — live

## fixed-price packages {#fixed-price-packages}

i also offer fixed-price packages for scoped deliverables starting at $10k

**not sure which package fits?**  
you have a pilot that's stalled → [pilot-to-production sprint](/offers/pilot-to-production-sprint)  
you need AI tools talking to real systems → [mcp server build sprint](/offers/mcp-server-sprint)  
you're worried about identity, permissions, audit → [ai governance layer setup](/offers/ai-governance-setup)  
you're unsure what's fragile in your AI stack → [ai architecture audit](/offers/ai-architecture-audit)  
you're making funding or build/buy decisions → [genai prioritization](/offers/genai-prioritization-workshop) or [build vs buy](/offers/build-vs-buy-analysis)  

## what i've shipped

[inner](https://innerdreamapp.com) — emotional memory for LLMs, available as a chatgpt app and on iOS

[apprentice](https://learnart.app) — AI-powered art study across 37,000+ masterworks

both run on [gatewaystack](https://gatewaystack.com), the trust and governance layer i built for user-scoped AI access. it handles identity, permissions, and auditability.
