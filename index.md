# reducibl

reducibl is about reducing complexity — making applied AI systems simpler, more intuitive, and easier to build.

I design and build AI products, agentic systems, and trust layers like GatewayStack. Previously at AWS; now helping teams ship real AI systems fast using tools like the OpenAI Apps SDK, MCP servers, and modern cloud infrastructure.

- Built AI apps that run inside ChatGPT via the Apps SDK  
- Designed model gateways for user-scoped, auditable model access  
- Shipped multiple production AI apps and internal copilots  
- Helped teams move from no-code MVPs to real AI backends
