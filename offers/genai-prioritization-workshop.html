<h1 style="font-size:2.2rem; margin-bottom:0.25rem;">genai initiative prioritization</h1>
<p style="font-size:1.1rem; color:var(--muted); margin-bottom:1.5rem;">stop guessing which AI projects to fund. build a portfolio view and prioritize with confidence.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top:0;">the problem</h2>

<p>your organization has a dozen AI ideas floating around — from leadership, from teams, from vendors. some are promising. some are science projects. you don't have a framework to tell which is which, and you definitely don't have a way to explain it to the board.</p>

<p>most genai initiatives never make it from pilot to production. not because the technology fails, but because nobody built the portfolio logic to know which bets to place and which to kill early.</p>

<h2>what you get</h2>

<p><strong>a prioritized AI initiative roadmap</strong> including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>initiative inventory — every AI project and idea surfaced, documented, and categorized</li>
  <li>scoring framework — a repeatable model your team can use going forward (not just this one time)</li>
  <li>portfolio map — risk vs. reward visualization showing where each initiative sits</li>
  <li>prioritized recommendations — what to fund, what to pilot, what to kill, and why</li>
  <li>executive summary — a clear narrative for leadership and board communication</li>
</ul>

<hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid rgba(35,30,92,0.15); margin: 2rem 0;">

<h2>how it works</h2>

<p><strong>week 1 — discovery:</strong> i interview 4-6 key stakeholders (30 min each) to surface initiatives, understand organizational context, and identify constraints. i also review any existing AI strategy docs or roadmaps.</p>

<p><strong>week 2 — analysis & scoring:</strong> i build the scoring framework, map the portfolio, and draft the prioritized roadmap. you get a draft to review before the workshop.</p>

<p><strong>week 3 — workshop session (4 hours):</strong> i facilitate a working session with your leadership team. we walk through the portfolio, pressure-test the scores, debate the hard calls, and align on priorities. you leave with a plan everyone has bought into.</p>

  <li>leadership teams with multiple AI initiatives competing for resources</li>
  <li>organizations moving from "experimenting with AI" to "investing in AI strategically"</li>
  <li>PE-backed companies that need a defensible AI strategy, not just a list of projects</li>
</ul>
