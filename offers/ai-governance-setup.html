<h1 style="font-size:2.2rem; margin-bottom:0.25rem;">ai governance layer setup</h1>
<p style="font-size:1.1rem; color:var(--muted); margin-bottom:1.5rem;">identity, permissions, and audit trails for your AI systems — powered by <a href="https://gatewaystack.com">gatewaystack</a>.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top:0;">the problem</h2>

<p>your AI tools work. but they run on shared API keys, there's no per-user identity, and you can't answer basic questions like "who accessed what data through the AI?" or "what did the model do on behalf of this user?"</p>

<p>this is the governance gap. every AI system hits it eventually — usually right when compliance asks, or right when something goes wrong.</p>

<h2>what you get</h2>

<p><strong>a working governance layer</strong> integrated into your AI stack:</p>

<ul>
  <li>user-scoped identity — every AI interaction tied to a real user, not a shared key</li>
  <li>role-based permissions — different users get different tool access and data scopes</li>
  <li>audit trail — a queryable log of who did what, when, through which AI tool</li>
  <li>rate limiting — per-user usage controls to prevent runaway costs</li>
  <li>integration with your auth system — oauth, SSO, or whatever you're running</li>
</ul>

<p>built on <a href="https://gatewaystack.com">gatewaystack</a> — the identity and policy layer i built to solve the three-party problem in AI systems: user ↔ model ↔ backend. the same system i run in my own production products. not a prototype — already deployed and serving real users.</p>

<p><strong>architecture documentation</strong> — how the governance layer works, how to extend it, how to add new tools and scopes. written for your team.</p>

<hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid rgba(35,30,92,0.15); margin: 2rem 0;">

<h2>how it works</h2>

<p><strong>session 1 (4 hours):</strong> we map your current AI stack, identify the governance gaps, and design the identity and permissions model together. i'll start building the layer live during the session.</p>

<p><strong>async build (3-5 days):</strong> i implement the full governance layer — identity binding, permission enforcement, audit logging, rate limiting. daily updates, you can steer throughout.</p>

<p><strong>session 2 (2 hours):</strong> we deploy together, run through the audit trail, test the permissions model, and walk your team through maintenance. everything pushed to your repo.</p>

<hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid rgba(35,30,92,0.15); margin: 2rem 0;">

<h2>best for</h2>

<ul>
  <li>teams deploying AI tools to employees or customers who need per-user access control</li>
  <li>companies in regulated industries where "who accessed what through the AI" matters</li>
  <li>organizations running mcp servers, chatgpt plugins, or internal copilots without proper identity</li>
</ul>

<hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid rgba(35,30,92,0.15); margin: 2rem 0;">

<h2>pricing</h2>

<p><strong>$10,000</strong> — includes both sessions, async build, deployment, and documentation.</p>

<p style="color:var(--muted); font-size:0.95rem;">typical timeline: 1-2 weeks from kickoff to deployed. complexity depends on your existing auth setup and number of AI tools to govern.</p>
