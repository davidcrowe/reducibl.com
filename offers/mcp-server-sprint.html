<h1 style="font-size:2.2rem; margin-bottom:0.25rem;">mcp server build sprint</h1>
<p style="font-size:1.1rem; color:var(--muted); margin-bottom:1.5rem;">zero to production mcp server in one week. deployed, documented, yours.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top:0;">the problem</h2>

<p>you want your AI tools to connect to your systems — databases, APIs, internal services. mcp is the way to do it, but the spec is moving fast, auth is tricky, and most tutorials stop at "hello world."</p>

<p>you need a production server with real auth, real error handling, and real documentation — not a weekend prototype.</p>

<hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid rgba(35,30,92,0.15); margin: 2rem 0;">

<h2>what you get</h2>

<p><strong>a production-ready mcp server</strong> with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>custom tools wired to your backend systems (databases, APIs, internal services)</li>
  <li>user-scoped authentication — not a shared API key, actual per-user identity</li>
  <li>role-based access control for different tool permissions</li>
  <li>error handling and logging that works in production</li>
  <li>deployment to your infrastructure (or i'll set it up)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>documentation</strong> — how it works, how to add tools, how to maintain it. written for your team, not for me.</p>

<hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid rgba(35,30,92,0.15); margin: 2rem 0;">

<h2>how it works</h2>

<p><strong>day 1 — kickoff session (4 hours):</strong> we scope the server together. what tools, what backends, what auth model. then we start building — live, on-camera. you'll have a working skeleton by end of session.</p>

<p><strong>days 2-4 — async build:</strong> i build out the full server, tools, auth, tests, and deployment. you get daily updates and can steer as we go.</p>

<p><strong>day 5 — handoff session (2 hours):</strong> we deploy together, walk through the code, and make sure your team can maintain and extend it. everything pushed to your repo.</p>

<hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid rgba(35,30,92,0.15); margin: 2rem 0;">

<h2>pricing</h2>

<p><strong>$10,000</strong> — includes the kickoff session, async build, handoff session, deployment, and full documentation.</p>

<p style="color:var(--muted); font-size:0.95rem;">typical timeline: 1 week from kickoff to deployed server.</p>

<hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid rgba(35,30,92,0.15); margin: 2rem 0;">

<h2>best for</h2>

<ul>
  <li>teams building AI tools that need to talk to internal systems</li>
  <li>companies adopting claude, chatgpt, or custom agents and need proper tool infrastructure</li>
  <li>developers who've built a prototype mcp server and need it production-hardened</li>
</ul>
