<h1 style="font-size:2.2rem; margin-bottom:0.25rem;">pilot-to-production sprint</h1>
<p style="font-size:1.1rem; color:var(--muted); margin-bottom:1.5rem;">two weeks to ship your stalled AI pilot — or kill it with a clear post-mortem.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top:0;">the problem</h2>

<p>you built an AI pilot. it worked in demo. leadership was excited. then it stalled. maybe it's the data pipeline. maybe it's auth. maybe nobody knows who owns it. maybe the model output isn't reliable enough for production use.</p>

<p>the pilot isn't dead — it's stuck. and every week it sits there, it loses momentum and credibility.</p>

<h2>what you get</h2>

<p><strong>one of two outcomes in two weeks:</strong></p>

<p><strong>outcome A: shipped.</strong> the pilot is in production — deployed, monitored, with real users. not perfect, but real. includes whatever it takes to get there: hardening the data pipeline, adding auth, fixing reliability, setting up monitoring.</p>

<p><strong>outcome B: killed with clarity.</strong> if the pilot shouldn't ship, you'll know exactly why — and you'll have a written post-mortem documenting what worked, what didn't, and whether there's a viable path forward. no ambiguity. no zombie project.</p>

<h2>how it works</h2>

<p><strong>day 1 — assessment session (4 hours):</strong> we dig into the pilot together. what's built, what's blocking, what's the real gap between demo and production. i'll give you an honest read: can this ship in two weeks, or are we looking at a kill decision?</p>

<p><strong>days 2-9 — build sprint:</strong> i work on shipping the pilot, in collaboration with your team. daily async updates, mid-week check-in call. i'm hands-on-keyboard, not advising from the sideline.</p>

<p><strong>day 10 — handoff session (2 hours):</strong> we review what shipped (or the post-mortem), walk through the code and infrastructure, and make sure your team can maintain it going forward.</p>

<h2>best for</h2>

<ul>
  <li>teams with an AI pilot that's been sitting in staging for weeks (or months)</li>
  <li>founders who need to show production AI to investors or customers — soon</li>
  <li>engineering leads who know the pilot has potential but don't have bandwidth to push it across the line</li>
</ul>

<hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid rgba(35,30,92,0.15); margin: 2rem 0;">

<h2>pricing</h2>

<p><strong>$10,000</strong> — includes assessment session, two weeks of half-day sprints, daily updates, mid-week check-in, handoff session, and all code/documentation.</p>

<p style="color:var(--muted); font-size:0.95rem;">typical timeline: 2 weeks of half-day sprints. requires your team to be available for questions and decisions during the sprint.</p>
