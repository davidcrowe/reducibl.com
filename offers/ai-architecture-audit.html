<h1 style="font-size:2.2rem; margin-bottom:0.25rem;">ai architecture audit</h1>
<p style="font-size:1.1rem; color:var(--muted); margin-bottom:1.5rem;">a focused review of your AI stack — with a written action plan you can execute immediately.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top:0;">the problem</h2>

<p>you've built AI features — maybe a chatbot, some agents, an internal copilot. but you're not sure if the architecture will hold. identity is bolted on. data flows are unclear. you're not sure what breaks when you scale or add another model provider.</p>

<p>most teams don't need more features. they need someone to look under the hood and tell them what's sound, what's fragile, and what to fix first.</p>

<h2>what you get</h2>

<p><strong>a written architecture review</strong> covering:</p>

<ul>
  <li>model integration patterns — how you're calling LLMs, where the coupling is, what's brittle</li>
  <li>identity and access — who's calling what, how tokens flow, where auth gaps exist</li>
  <li>data flow and storage — how data moves through your AI stack, where it leaks or duplicates</li>
  <li>security posture — prompt injection surface, secrets management, audit gaps</li>
  <li>infrastructure and scaling — what holds and what doesn't as usage grows</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>a prioritized action plan</strong> — not a 50-page report. a ranked list of what to fix, in what order, with concrete recommendations. the kind of doc your team can start executing on the same week.</p>

<h2>how it works</h2>

<p><strong>session 1 (4 hours):</strong> live walkthrough of your codebase, infrastructure, and architecture. i'll ask questions, poke at the weak points, and map the system with you in real time.</p>

<p><strong>between sessions:</strong> i write up the review and action plan. you get a draft to review before we meet again.</p>

<p><strong>session 2 (2 hours):</strong> we walk through the findings together. i'll answer questions, adjust priorities based on your context, and make sure the action plan is something your team can actually execute.</p>

<hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid rgba(35,30,92,0.15); margin: 2rem 0;">

<h2>best for</h2>

<ul>
  <li>teams with AI in production (or close to it) who want a second pair of eyes</li>
  <li>founders who've built fast and want to know where the risks are before scaling</li>
  <li>engineering leads evaluating whether their AI infrastructure is ready for the next phase</li>
</ul>

<h2>pricing</h2>

<p><strong>$10,000</strong> — includes both sessions and the written deliverable.</p>

<p style="color:var(--muted); font-size:0.95rem;">typical timeline: 1-2 weeks from kickoff to final deliverable.</p>
