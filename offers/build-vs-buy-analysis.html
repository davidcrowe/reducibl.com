<h1 style="font-size:2.2rem; margin-bottom:0.25rem;">build vs buy analysis</h1>
<p style="font-size:1.1rem; color:var(--muted); margin-bottom:1.5rem;">a structured analysis of whether to build or buy AI capabilities — with cost models and a clear recommendation.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top:0;">the problem</h2>

<p>you're deciding whether to build AI capabilities in-house or buy from vendors. it's a high-stakes call — build when you should've bought and you burn engineering months. buy when you should've built and you're locked into a vendor that doesn't fit.</p>

<p>most teams make this decision based on vibes, vendor demos, or whoever talks loudest in the room. you need a framework — cost models, risk analysis, and a recommendation grounded in your actual constraints.</p>

<h2>what you get</h2>

<p><strong>a build vs buy recommendation brief</strong> covering:</p>

<ul>
  <li>capability inventory — every AI capability mapped, with build and buy options for each</li>
  <li>total cost of ownership — not just sticker price. engineering time, maintenance, integration costs, talent requirements for build; licensing, lock-in risk, migration costs for buy</li>
  <li>risk analysis — what you control and what you don't under each scenario</li>
  <li>vendor landscape — if buying, which vendors are credible for your use cases and which are selling demos</li>
  <li>decision framework — a repeatable model your team can use for future build/buy decisions, not just this one</li>
  <li>recommendation brief — clear recommendation per capability, with reasoning your leadership can act on</li>
</ul>

<h2>how it works</h2>

<p><strong>week 1 — discovery:</strong> i interview key stakeholders and your engineering team to understand the capabilities you need, your current stack, team capacity, and constraints. i also evaluate the vendor options in your space.</p>

<p><strong>week 2 — analysis:</strong> i build the cost models, map the decision framework, evaluate vendors, and draft the recommendation brief. you get a draft to review before the workshop.</p>

<p><strong>week 3 — workshop session (3 hours):</strong> we walk through the analysis with your leadership and engineering leads. pressure-test the assumptions, debate the hard calls, and align on a path forward.</p>

<hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid rgba(35,30,92,0.15); margin: 2rem 0;">

<h2>best for</h2>

<ul>
  <li>CTOs and engineering leads deciding whether to build or buy AI infrastructure</li>
  <li>teams evaluating AI vendors without a structured framework</li>
  <li>leadership making investment decisions about AI capabilities and needing a defensible analysis</li>
</ul>
