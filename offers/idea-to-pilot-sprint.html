<h1 style="font-size:2.2rem; margin-bottom:0.25rem;">idea-to-pilot sprint</h1>
<p style="font-size:1.1rem; color:var(--muted); margin-bottom:1.5rem;">one week to turn your AI idea into a working pilot — validated, functional, ready to demo.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top:0;">the problem</h2>

<p>you have an AI idea. maybe it's been in a slide deck for months. maybe it came out of a strategy session. maybe a founder sketched it on a napkin. either way — nobody's validated whether it actually works with real data, real users, real constraints.</p>

<p>you don't need a six-month roadmap. you need someone to build the thing in a week and tell you if it's viable.</p>

<h2>what you get</h2>

<p><strong>a working pilot in one week:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>functional AI system — not a mockup, not slides. a working system you can put in front of real users or stakeholders</li>
  <li>scoped to the core value prop — we build the one thing that proves (or disproves) the idea, not the whole product</li>
  <li>real data integration — connected to your actual data sources, not synthetic demos</li>
  <li>viability assessment — honest evaluation of what works, what doesn't, and whether this should go to production</li>
  <li>architecture brief — how it's built, what decisions were made, and what the path to production looks like if you decide to proceed</li>
</ul>

<hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid rgba(35,30,92,0.15); margin: 2rem 0;">

<h2>how it works</h2>

<p><strong>day 1 — scoping session (4 hours):</strong> we define the pilot together. what's the core hypothesis? what data exists? what's the simplest thing that proves the idea works? we start building live in the session.</p>

<p><strong>days 2-4 — async build:</strong> i build the pilot. daily updates, you can steer as we go. i'll flag blockers early — if something about the idea doesn't hold up, you'll know on day 2, not day 10.</p>

<p><strong>day 5 — demo + handoff (2 hours):</strong> we demo the pilot, review the viability assessment, and walk through the architecture. you leave with a working system and a clear picture of what comes next.</p>

<hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid rgba(35,30,92,0.15); margin: 2rem 0;">

<h2>best for</h2>

<ul>
  <li>founders with an AI product idea who need to validate it before committing resources</li>
  <li>teams with an AI use case stuck in slide decks that needs to become something real</li>
  <li>leaders who need a working demo for stakeholders or investors — not a prototype, something functional</li>
</ul>

<hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid rgba(35,30,92,0.15); margin: 2rem 0;">

<h2>pricing</h2>

<p><strong>$10,000</strong> — includes scoping session, async build, demo + handoff, and the viability assessment with architecture brief.</p>

<p style="color:var(--muted); font-size:0.95rem;">typical timeline: 1 week from kickoff to working pilot.</p>
