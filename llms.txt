# reducibl

> live, on demand applied ai strategy and engineering — from idea to production in weeks.

reducibl is the applied AI practice of david crowe. he works directly with founders and teams to build AI systems — live, on-camera, in focused sessions. previously aws, dell. harvard, uchicago.

## services

### sprint sessions
live collaborative building sessions. 4 hours ($1,200) or 8 hours ($2,000). start with a free 45-minute intro call where we build something together live.

### fixed-price packages (starting at $10k)

packages follow a natural progression: assess → build → harden.

assess:
- ai architecture audit ($10,000): focused review of your AI stack — model integration, identity, data flow, security — with a prioritized action plan. two sessions plus written deliverable.
- genai initiative prioritization ($10,000): source, score, and prioritize AI initiatives as a portfolio. 3-week engagement with stakeholder interviews and leadership workshop.
- build vs buy analysis ($10,000): structured analysis of whether to build or buy AI capabilities with cost models, vendor evaluation, and a clear recommendation. 3-week engagement.

build:
- idea-to-pilot sprint ($10,000): one week to turn an AI idea into a working pilot — validated, functional, ready to demo. scoping session, async build, and demo + handoff.
- mcp server build sprint ($10,000): zero to production mcp server in one week. deployed, documented, with user-scoped auth and role-based access control.
- pilot-to-production sprint ($10,000): two weeks of half-day sprints to ship a stalled AI pilot to production — or kill it with a clear post-mortem.

harden:
- ai governance layer setup ($10,000): identity, permissions, and audit trails for AI systems. built on gatewaystack.

### fractional
ongoing arrangements for AI strategy, architecture, and shipping. 8-20 hours/week on monthly retainer.

## products

- apprentice (https://learnart.app): AI-powered art study across 37,000+ masterworks
- gatewaystack (https://gatewaystack.com): trust and governance layer for user-scoped AI access — handles identity, permissions, and auditability
