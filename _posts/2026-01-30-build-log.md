### what i shipped today
i built the core logic and handlers for three new apps: loop (experimental learning), hunch (predictions), and fork (decision archaeology). these are designed to capture different aspects of human cognition, expanding the "inner" app into a more comprehensive decision intelligence suite.

### path-based routing for the win
i'm building a suite of ai-powered apps, and i wanted them all accessible from the same domain. the solution was path-based routing — `/inner`, `/loop`, `/hunch`, etc. each app now has its own url endpoint, and i can keep the codebase organized. a shared architectural pattern across all four apps simplifies development and maintenance.

### auth0: first-party struggles
getting ready to submit inner to the chatgpt store and claude’s platform meant jumping through some auth0 hoops. i needed to enable username-password authentication for the submission test user. turns out, you can't do that directly in the dashboard for regular web applications. the workaround? using the auth0 management api to set the `is_first_party` flag.

### scout: a new app idea
i’m kicking around a new app idea called "scout" — personalized recommendations for real-life activities. the big challenge is the cold start problem. how do you provide useful recommendations when you have no data on a new user? i'm weighing cross-user collaborative filtering versus content-based filtering.
