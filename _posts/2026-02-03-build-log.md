### what i shipped today
i got the greenshoot enrichment script running smoothly with batch processing and fuzzy matching. the landing page is live on firebase, and i'm tracking waitlist sign-ups. plus, i'm getting a better handle on the competitive landscape.

### batch processing saves the day
the enrichment script was crashing with "out of memory" errors. turns out, loading 1,033 plant profiles and all their associated pdfs and docxs at once is a lot. i rewrote the script to process plants in batches of 50, and memory usage is now stable. a simple fix, but a crucial one.

### fuzzy matching for dundee data
the dundee edible plants data wasn't merging with the usda data because of scientific name mismatches. i implemented fuzzy matching using the `string-similarity` library, and now i'm getting a 100% match rate on the first batch. it's amazing how much difference a little fuzziness can make.

### landing page is live
the greenshoot landing page is now live on firebase. i connected it to the existing `joinwaitlist` cloud function, and i'm tracking sign-ups. i also added plausible analytics to the page, so i can see how people are using it.
