### what i shipped today
i finally shipped gatemyagent to agenticcontrolplane.com. it's a live demo showing the power of agentic control planes. lots of ui tweaks, a new faq, and a complete rewrite of the audit log to match our existing explicabl format.

### from get_secrets to get_environment_config
the original demo had a `get_secrets` function, which felt a bit contrived. i renamed it to `get_environment_config` to be more realistic. it now represents common config endpoints that accidentally leak database urls, api tokens, and service credentials.

### rbac in action
i added an agent role selector with three roles: customer support, employee, and admin. each role has different access levels. customer support can only see `get_customers`, while admin has full access. it's a powerful way to demonstrate rbac at the infrastructure level.

### audit logs, explicabl style
the audit log was completely rewritten to match the explicabl format from our gatewaystack-connect dashboard. it's now a table with columns for time, tool, status, client, and response time. each row is clickable to show the full json details.
