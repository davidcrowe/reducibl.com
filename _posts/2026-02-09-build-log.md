### what i shipped today
i shipped five new integrations for agentic control plane: jira, google workspace (gmail + calendar), notion, linear, and confluence. i also did a bunch of seo cleanup on reducibl.com, and fixed a custom connector bug. a busy day of building and polishing.

### oauth refactor
i refactored the oauth flows for github and salesforce into a shared `oauthintegration` base module. it's in `src/integrations/oauth.ts`. this cut down on code duplication and makes it way easier to add new oauth-based integrations. less code, fewer bugs, faster iteration… the usual benefits.

### custom connector bug fix
i fixed a bug in the custom connector page where the bearer token wasn't being passed to the `mcptoolscall` function when testing custom tools. the fix was in `customconnectorpage.tsx`. now users can test their custom tools with the right auth.

### seo tweaks for reducibl.com
i tackled some seo issues on the reducibl.com jekyll site. that meant fixing broken links, adding redirects, standardizing permalinks, and adding an organization schema. small changes, but they add up. plus, i added a bar chart of daily tool calls to the build logs.

### instagram content pipeline
i automated the instagram content pipeline for learnart.app. that includes generating captions, resizing text on carousels, and downloading images from wikimedia commons after running into issues with wikiart's download restrictions. it's all about creating a consistent flow of engaging content.
