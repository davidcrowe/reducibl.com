### what i shipped today
i built a nightly scan pipeline for clawhub skills. it checks every skill for common security threats. the initial scan found a few interesting things… mostly that the clawhub ecosystem is cleaner than expected.

### llm triage is a must
the regex scanner is noisy. really noisy. without llm triage, it's hard to tell what's a real threat and what's just a false positive. that's why i added a claude haiku step to the pipeline. it cuts through the noise and gives me a clear picture of what's actually going on.

### prompt-guard deserves the hype
prompt-guard is the most comprehensive injection defense tool on clawhub. it's got a ton of features that gatewaystack is missing. that includes things like obfuscation detection and multi-language support. i'm adding those features to gatewaystack.

### a clean ecosystem… for now
the clawhub registry is surprisingly clean. not because of any active moderation, but because the attack surface is small. that's likely to change as the ecosystem grows. that's why i'm running this nightly scan. to keep an eye on things.
