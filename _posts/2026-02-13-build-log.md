### what i shipped today
i spent most of the day fighting fires—a disastrous email campaign sent to the wrong waitlist and a broken auth0 login flow on the live site. finally got the auth0 redirect loop sorted. also shipped the new emotions tab and fixed the tool auth on inner.

### from art students to enterprise ai buyers… whoops
an email about "the thing most art students get wrong" went out to my enterprise ai waitlist. turns out, the drip email system had a bug where it defaulted to the "apprentice" email sequence if it couldn't figure out the waitlist source. gatewaystack signups weren't being recognized. shut the whole thing down for now. will revisit with a proper segmented strategy.

### auth0 + firebase cookie conflict
spent way too long wrestling with auth0's redirect urls. kept getting "invalid state parameter" errors after login. the culprit? firebase hosting strips all cookies except `__session`. auth0 sdk uses other cookies for the login flow — a fundamental incompatibility. migrating to firebase app hosting, which doesn't have this restriction.

### app hosting auth… finally working
after hours of debugging, the auth0 flow is finally working on firebase app hosting. had to create `.env.production` with the correct callback url and configure the app hosting backend. cookies are now persisting properly, and users can log in successfully.


### fixing the conversation title race condition
noticed the conversation titles weren't populating. a react closure bug was dropping the `title` sse event. fixed it by using a ref to bridge the gap between the `conversation_created` and `title` events. simple fix, big improvement to the user experience.
