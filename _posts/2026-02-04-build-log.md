### what i shipped today
i finished setting up the greenshoot landing page with firebase hosting and plausible analytics. i also fixed a bunch of issues with the build log automation, including token expiration and missing data. the build logs are now more accurate and comprehensive.

### greenshoot: landing page live
the greenshoot landing page is now live on greenshoot.app. i configured the dns records in cloudflare and added a redirect for `www.greenshoot.app`. i also added plausible analytics to track visits and waitlist signups. it's exciting to see the project taking shape.

### build log automation: firestore to the rescue
i realized i was committing screenshots to github *before* i had a chance to review them — a potential security nightmare. i completely reworked the build log function to store everything in firestore first, then email me a draft with inline screenshots. only when i click "approve" does it commit to github. this was a big win for peace of mind.

### enriching the data
i'm focused on building a rich and informative dataset of plant information for greenshoot. i'm leveraging ai to enrich this data and provide a guided growing experience for users. the goal is to create a data flywheel: enrich public data -> users generate local data -> predictions improve -> moat.
