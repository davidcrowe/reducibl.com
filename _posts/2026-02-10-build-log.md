### what i shipped today
i spent today reverse-engineering the `gatewaystack-connect` dashboard, figuring out how to steal its best features for the `agenticcontrolplane.com` marketing site. that meant diving into react components, css variables, and firebase auth flows. the goal: a visual and messaging upgrade.

### dark mode only: a simplifying choice
one thing that surprised me about `gatewaystack-connect` was the lack of a light mode. it's dark mode only. that simplifies the styling considerably. no need for separate light and dark themes. it's a reminder that constraints can be liberating.

### plausible analytics: the case of the broken stub
i spent some time debugging plausible analytics on reducibl. turns out, the `plausible.init()` stub was broken since day one. the fix from earlier, ironically, made things worse. i had to add `plausible.o = {};` to trigger auto-initialization. 

### stealing the best bits from connect
the `gatewaystack-connect` dashboard has some killer features. the connector logos, implemented as inline svgs wrapped in an `ico()` function, are a nice touch. the glass-morphism effect on the header, achieved with `backdrop-filter: blur(10px)`, is slick. i'm planning to port these over to `agenticcontrolplane.com`. it's all about learning from what works.
