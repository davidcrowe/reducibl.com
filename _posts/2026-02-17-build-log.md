### what i shipped today
i added and committed the blog post "22 security tools on clawhub" and its open graph image. also, i pushed pre-launch hardening changes to gatewaystack-connect, including cors lockdown, debug gating, and auth log reduction.

### clawhub: a security audit
i spent a chunk of the day analyzing security tools on the clawhub registry. injection detection is deep — 550+ patterns, encoding tricks, homoglyphs. but only 2 of 20+ tools attempt real governance. very few monitor runtime behavior after install. and if your agent sends an email with sensitive data because it misunderstood the task — not because of an attack — nearly nothing catches that either.

i mapped what a complete agent security stack would need — six layers, from identity to runtime monitoring to inter-tool coordination. today, three are covered well, one is emerging, and two are gaps.

### gatewaystack-connect: pre-launch hardening
i'm getting gatewaystack-connect ready for public use. that means locking down security and making sure everything is production-ready. i've been focusing on hardening the system, including cors lockdown, gating debug endpoints, and reducing auth logging verbosity. it's all about minimizing the attack surface and ensuring that sensitive data isn't exposed.
