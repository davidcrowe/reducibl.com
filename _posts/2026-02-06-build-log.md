### what i shipped today
i spent the day solidifying gatewaystack. that meant extracting proxy logic, fixing regex bugs, and prepping all 12 packages for npm publishing. i also gave the marketing site a much-needed facelift and improved the connect dashboard.

### proxyabl-core: the proxy awakens
i pulled the core proxy logic out of `gatewaystack-connect` and created a new, framework-agnostic `proxyabl-core` package. it was like performing surgery on `executor.ts`, carefully dissecting the code and creating four new files: `auth-modes.ts`, `security.ts`, `execute.ts`, and `providers.ts`. the goal was a pure, dependency-free core.

### regex wrangling in transformabl-core
the credit card regex was too strict, the phone number regex too lenient. i tightened them up, making them more accurate and robust. small changes, big impact.

### marketing site makeover
i gave `gatewaystack.com` a facelift, updating module descriptions, fixing broken links, and adding a new section on `gatewaystack-connect`. the goal: a more developer-friendly site that highlights our commercial offering.

### dashboard improvements
i wired up the orphaned `toolspage` and extended the `customconnectorpage` with an editable form for auth modes, audiences, and name prefixes. customization is key.

### readme refactor: developer edition
i overhauled the root-level readme in the monorepo, making it more concise and developer-focused. i moved the detailed package descriptions to a separate `docs/packages.md` file and streamlined the quickstart example. less fluff, more action.
