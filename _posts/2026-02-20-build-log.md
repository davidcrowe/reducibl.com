### what i shipped today
i finally got the daily build log sync set up on the mac mini. that means claude code transcripts will automatically get synced to gcs and trigger the build log cloud function. i also backfilled the missing days since feb 15th.

### fnm versus nvm
the sync script assumes `nvm` for node version management. but this machine uses `fnm`. that meant updating the shell script to detect and load `fnm` if `nvm` isn't found. tiny detail, but it would have broken the cron job silently.

### symlinking for the win
the sync script expects the `serviceaccountkey.json` file in a specific relative path. i put it in a different directory. instead of moving the file, i created a symlink. less intrusive, easier to undo.

### plausible analytics on the demo
the new "gatemystack" demo tab on agenticcontrolplane.com needed analytics. i added the plausible script to track pageviews and custom events like attack submissions and settings changes. now i can see how people are using the demo.
