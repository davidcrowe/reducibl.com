<div class="version-content" data-version="linkedin" markdown="1">

i'm building a portfolio of AI apps. but i'm starting to realize the apps aren't the real product.

*the enriched data is.*

here's what i mean.

i've been enriching a dataset of 37,000+ artworks with AI-generated analysis — style breakdowns, technique notes, historical context. the enrichment job is 85% complete.

the app that surfaces this data? incidental. 

it could be a chatgpt app. a web app. a mobile app. or all three of the above. the distribution channel can change.

but the enriched dataset? that's mine. it compounds. it gets better over time. it's defensible.

### the mental model

**apps are flywheels.** they generate usage, feedback, and more data.

**data is the asset.** it's what you actually own. it's what makes the next version of the app better than anyone else's.

the same AI that powers your competitors' apps can power yours. but the data you've collected and enriched? that's the moat.

### what this means practically

when i'm deciding what to build next, i ask:

- what data will this generate?
- can i enrich it over time?
- will it make my next product better?

if the answer is no, it's a feature, not a product.

if the answer is yes, it's worth building — even if the first version is rough.

what's your moat?
