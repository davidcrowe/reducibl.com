### what i shipped today
i launched a new ai governance readiness diagnostic at `/diagnostic` on reducibl.com. it's a 2-minute self-assessment to help potential clients identify gaps in their ai governance posture. it's designed to be a low-friction conversion step between reading my content and booking a call.

### vanilla js
i wanted to keep the diagnostic lightweight, so i avoided adding any new dependencies. that meant writing all the js from scratch. it's a reminder that even in 2026, vanilla js is sometimes the right tool for the job.

the core logic is an iife that manages state transitions, calculates scores, and handles form submissions. it's not pretty, but it gets the job done.

### formspree: the backend of least resistance
i needed a way to capture the diagnostic results, but i didn't want to over-engineer a backend. i opted for formspree, a simple service that handles form submissions and sends them to my email.

it's a quick and dirty solution, but it allows me to focus on the core experience. i can always swap it out for a more robust backend later if needed.

### testing ctas
the diagnostic results page has two different ctas, depending on the user's score:

- exposed/emerging: an email form to get a personalized take
- structured/advanced: a link to book a 30-minute working session

this allows me to informally test which cta is more effective at converting leads. i'll be tracking the results in plausible.
