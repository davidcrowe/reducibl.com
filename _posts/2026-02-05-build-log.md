### what i shipped today
i shipped a bunch of small but important changes to reducibl. that includes a local meetup page, a structured approach to linkedin, and a subtle credential bump on the homepage. all those changes are about making it easier for people to find me and decide if i'm legit.

### la jolla ai build: the origin story
i'm starting a local ai build group. it's a chance to build in public, meet other builders, and maybe even find some clients. the problem: how do you signal "this is worth my time" without being spammy?

the answer: a dedicated page on reducibl.com. it's not linked from the main site, but it's there for anyone who wants to learn more. it includes:

- what it is, when, where
- what to bring
- how to rsvp (link to meetup)
- subtle "organized by david crowe" footer that links back to my homepage

the key is to make it about the group, not about me.

### linkedin: from private to public
i've always kept my linkedin profile pretty locked down. i figured it was just for recruiters and old colleagues. but i'm realizing that's a mistake.

if i want to attract clients, i need to be visible. that means:

- a public profile with a clear headline and description
- a consistent stream of content that shows what i know
- engagement with other people in the ai space

it's uncomfortable, but it's necessary.

### the power of small numbers
seven people joined my meetup group in less than a day. i know, small number. but feels like good start! it's a reminder that you don't need a million followers to build a business. you just need a few people who care about what you're doing.
