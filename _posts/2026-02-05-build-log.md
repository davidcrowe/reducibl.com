### what i shipped today
i just finished a complete overhaul of reducibl.com — from seo and llm optimization to new productized offerings. the goal was to make it easier for potential clients to find me, understand my value, and take the next step. plus, i created a local meetup group and a related landing page to start building community.

### moving from strategy to execution
initially, i had organized the offerings on my site into "strategy" and "execution" categories. it felt a little forced. after some thought, i realized it's more about the customer journey.

that led to a new framework: assess → build → harden. it felt more natural. i also added a new offering: "idea-to-pilot sprint." now, the journey is more complete — from initial idea to shipped product.

### github-style activity grid
i added a github-style activity grid to the build logs page. it shows the last 365 days of activity. each cell is colored based on how many tool calls were made that day. it's a quick way to see my coding activity and click through to specific days.

i initially tried to add a legend, but it cluttered the design. so i removed it and just let the grid speak for itself.

### linkedin and the private network
i've always kept my linkedin profile pretty locked down. i figured i'd rather have people discover me through my work. but i realized that's a mistake.

my private network isn't really aligned with what i'm doing now. i need to build a new one. that means putting myself out there, engaging with others, and making it easy for people to find and vet me. so i made my linkedin profile mostly public. i also added my credentials to the footer of my website.

### local meetup group
i created a local meetup group called "la jolla ai build." it's a bi-weekly, no-bs session for people who actually ship ai. no talks, no pitches, no panels. just building.

to support it, i created a simple landing page on my website to share the details. i'm hoping to attract a few regulars who are serious about building. i'm excited to see what comes of it.
