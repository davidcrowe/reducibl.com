### what i shipped today
today was all about resurrecting the openclaw governance skill. it started with a broken repo, moved through a deep dive into typescript transpilation, and ended with a working build pushed to a private github repo.

### the case of the missing package.json
i was setting up the openclaw repo on a new machine and discovered a major problem: the `.gitignore` was blanket-ignoring all `.json` files. that meant `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, and `package-lock.json` weren't in git. claude helped me fix the `.gitignore` and commit the missing files, but even then, it took a while to get git to cooperate on the other side. turns out i was on the wrong branch.

### taming the typescript transpiler
the biggest surprise was the custom typescript transpiler i'd written for this project. it was fragile and broken. the regex i used to strip generics was eating comparison operators, mangling the code. i had to rewrite the transpiler, fixing bugs and adding support for new typescript features.

### github, finally
after hours of debugging git and wrestling with the transpiler, i finally had a working build. i pushed it to a private github repo. the openclaw governance skill is back from the dead.
