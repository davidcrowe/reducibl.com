### what i shipped today
i picked a profile picture for the apprentice instagram account and consolidated gatewaystack.com into agenticcontrolplane.com. also, i added comprehensive analytics tracking to all three sites.

### unmasking phantom form submissions
analytics are useless if they're misleading. i realized the "form submissions" goal in plausible was a lie — auto-detected events, not real conversions. that meant i needed to swap in explicit plausible events on the newsletter form and chatflow widget. now i can actually trust the conversion data.

### riffian for the win
i went with seated riffian for the learnart.app profile pic. it's bold, colorful, and reads well at any size. plus, it stands out from the typical art profile pic. it's a bit of a risk — not as instantly recognizable as the girl with a pearl earring — but it has more visual impact.

i also had to nudge the crop up a bit to keep the turban from getting cut off. details matter.

### consolidating the stack
i finally pulled the trigger on consolidating gatewaystack.com into agenticcontrolplane.com. it makes sense to focus on the category (agentic control plane) rather than the product (gatewaystack). i migrated the developer docs, the connect product page, and the blog posts. plus, i set up a redirect so all traffic goes to agenticcontrolplane.com. it's simpler to manage one site.
